## Add icons
Download the font from the repo below or other font, 
and put into ~/.local/share/fonts

this is the repo where i get the font, is Hack nerd font
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/complete/Hack%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf

## Signify
il plug signify mi consente di mostrare le icone 
di linee aggiunte, modificate o rimosse. 

    `+`     This line was added.

    `!`     This line was modified.

    `_1`    The number of deleted lines below this sign. If the number is larger
    `99`    than 9, the `_` will be omitted. For numbers larger than 99, `_>`
    `_>`    will be shown instead.

    `!1`    This line was modified and the lines below were deleted.
    `!>`    It is a combination of `!` and `_`. If the number is larger than 9,
          `!>` will be shown instead.

    `â€¾`     The first line was removed. It's a special case of the `_` sign.
    
I Wrote also a configuration for this plug-in.
